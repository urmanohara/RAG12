Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

With the continuous advancement of neural net-\\nworks and deep learning, text embeddings have evolved from early sparse representa-\\ntions (e.g., BM25[1]) to dense representations based on ﬁne-tuned deep networks such\\nas BERT[2] and T5[3], leading to signiﬁcant performance improvements[4][5][6][7][8]. In\\n2022, the rise of large language models (LLMs), exempliﬁed by ChatGPT[9], ushered in\\na new era of text embeddings based on LLM representations, including models like text-\\nembedding-3-large and RepLLaMA[10]. Recent research on optimizing text embedding\\nmodels has explored diverse perspectives and focal points. For instance, to address\\nthe limitation of decoder-only architectures—where causal attention mechanisms re-\\nstrict token embeddings to unidirectional semantic capture—several approaches have\\nbeen proposed: Echo Embedding[11] employs input repetition and instruction design\\nto enable preceding tokens to capture subsequent token semantics. LLM2Vec[12] modi-\\nﬁes attention to bi-directional mechanism to remove backward dependency constraints.\\nConan-Embedding-v2[13] proposes a novel soft masking mechanism combined with dy-\\nnamic rank reduction.\\nAnother widely adopted approach is knowledge distillation,\\nwhere text embeddings are treated as the ”signal states” representing textual seman-\\ntics. By distilling knowledge from high-performing teacher models to student models,\\nthe objective is to optimize the embedding performance. For instance, Jasper[14] em-\\nploys a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework, combining with multiple carefully\\ndesigned loss functions and ﬁnally achieving superior results. Debater[16] proposes a\\nstep-by-step thinking mechanism for embedding generation, iteratively optimizing doc-\\nument representations through continuous COT. Distillation is applied to constrain\\nthe ﬁnal token representation to learn the optimal semantic states from these thinking\\nsteps. Additionally, hard negative sampling has emerged as a crucial research direc-\\ntion in text embedding models, serving as a pivotal technique for model optimization.\\nANCE[18] identiﬁed that conventional dense retrieval training leads to diminishing gra-\\ndient norms during optimization. Thus they developed an asynchronous Approximate\\nNearest Neighbor (ANN) indexing mechanism that periodically refreshes the negative\\nsample pool using the current model parameters, thereby ensuring the maintenance\\nof up-to-date and optimally challenging negative samples. Both Conan-Embedding[24]\\nand its v2 version incorporated similar dynamic hard negative sampling techniques to\\nenhance model performance. NV-Embed[19] implemented an alternative approach by\\nleveraging their previously developed NV-Retriever’s[20] positive-aware negative min-\\ning strategy, including TopK-MarginPos and TopKPercPos ﬁltering mechanisms.\\nIn this work, we present QZhou-Embedding, built upon the powerful Qwen2.5-7B-\\nInstruct[21] model, which pushes the boundaries of text embedding capabilities. To\\nenhance the model’s semantic understanding, we designed a uniﬁed multi-task learn-\\ning framework that not only accommodates more diverse training data but also bring\\neﬃcient learning across three key tasks: retrieval, natural language inference (NLI),\\nand classiﬁcation. Our framework comprises two core components: 1. Data Trans-\\nformation: We carefully adapt data formats to the speciﬁc requirements of retrieval,\\nNLI, and classiﬁcation tasks, enabling eﬀective feature extraction from heterogeneous\\ndata sources, signiﬁcantly beneﬁting retrieval model training. 2.

This section describes the methodology for transforming and constructing training\\nsets from NLI-style data, using textual semantic similarity (STS) and textual entailment\\ntasks as illustrative examples. Our approach distinctively reformulates NLI tasks into\\ntext pair-score formats compatible with Cosent loss[49] training strategy, where sample\\npairs are quantitatively scored based on their semantic relationships. The processing\\nprocedures for each are detailed below:\\n• STS Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is characterized by its symmetric se-\\nmantic matching to determine whether two sentences share equivalent meaning.\\nSTS datasets typically consist of sentence pairs with associated labels, which may\\nbe binary classiﬁcations (yes/no, true/false) or numerical scores (e.g., 1.2, 3.1,\\n4.8). For binary labels, ”yes”/”true” are mapped to a numerical value of 1, while\\n”no”/”false” are converted to 0. The data is then structured into (query, docu-\\nment, score) triplets. Due to the symmetric nature of STS, each single original\\ndata sample can generate two training triplets by interchanging the query and\\npositive document roles.\\n• Textual Entailment Textual entailment further examines a model’s capabilities\\nin reasoning, typically featuring three-class labels: entailment, neutral, contradic-\\ntion.\\nOur processing method employs a three-tier scoring system: labels are\\nassigned values of 2, 1, and 0 for entailment, neutral, and contradiction respec-\\ntively. We construct (query, document, score) triplets accordingly, and similarly\\nleverage symmetry to double the dataset size.\\n3.2.3\\nCLS-oriented Process\\nClassiﬁcation tasks encompass text categorization and sentiment classiﬁcation scenar-\\nios, it typically follows a (text, label) format, where texts within the same category\\nexhibit semantic proximity while distinct boundaries separate diﬀerent classes. NV-\\nEmbed[47] compared label-based and example-based data construction methods, with\\nexperimental results demonstrating the superiority of the latter. Adopting the example-\\nbased approach, we process classiﬁcation data (text, label) by using the text as query,\\n7'),\n",

We designed a\\nuniﬁed multi-task framework comprising specialized data transformation and training\\nstrategies, eﬀectively enhanced the diversity of training data. To further improve the\\nquality of training data and the model’s generalization capabilities, we developed a data\\nsynthesis pipeline leveraging LLM API, incorporating techniques such as Paraphrasing,\\nAugmentation, and Hard negative example generation. We employ a two-stage training\\nstrategy comprising initial retrieval-focused training followed by full-task ﬁne-tuning,\\nenabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities based on robust retrieval per-\\nformance.\\nThe model achieves state-of-the-art results on the MTEB and CMTEB\\nbenchmarks, ranking ﬁrst on both leaderboards. Our ﬁndings establish that data qual-\\nity and diversity are pivotal for improving embedding model capabilities. In the future,\\nwe will focus on developing multimodal and multilingual embedding models, as well\\nas exploring eﬀective applications of embedding models in agent systems, aiming to\\nintegrate cutting-edge technologies to optimize this classical module.\\nReferences\\n[1] Robertson, Stephen E., and Steve Walker. ”Some simple eﬀective approximations to\\nthe 2-poisson model for probabilistic weighted retrieval.” In SIGIR’94: Proceedings\\n16'),\n",

Traditional object detection\\nmethods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable\\narchitectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing\\ncomplex ensembles which combine multiple low-level image\\nfeatures with high-level context from object detectors and scene\\nclassiﬁers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more\\npowerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level,\\ndeeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing\\nin traditional architectures. These models behave differently\\nin network architecture, training strategy and optimization\\nfunction, etc. In this paper, we provide a review on deep\\nlearning based object detection frameworks. Our review begins\\nwith a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and\\nits representative tool, namely Convolutional Neural Network\\n(CNN). Then we focus on typical generic object detection\\narchitectures along with some modiﬁcations and useful tricks\\nto improve detection performance further. As distinct speciﬁc\\ndetection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also brieﬂy\\nsurvey several speciﬁc tasks, including salient object detection,\\nface detection and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses\\nare also provided to compare various methods and draw some\\nmeaningful conclusions. Finally, several promising directions and\\ntasks are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in\\nboth object detection and relevant neural network based learning\\nsystems.\\nIndex Terms—deep learning, object detection, neural network\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nT\\nO gain a complete image understanding, we should not\\nonly concentrate on classifying different images, but\\nalso try to precisely estimate the concepts and locations of\\nobjects contained in each image. This task is referred as object\\ndetection [1][S1], which usually consists of different subtasks\\nsuch as face detection [2][S2], pedestrian detection [3][S2]\\nand skeleton detection [4][S3]. As one of the fundamental\\ncomputer vision problems, object detection is able to provide\\nvaluable information for semantic understanding of images\\nand videos, and is related to many applications, including\\nimage classiﬁcation [5], [6], human behavior analysis [7][S4],\\nface recognition [8][S5] and autonomous driving [9], [10].\\nMeanwhile, Inheriting from neural networks and related learn-\\ning systems, the progress in these ﬁelds will develop neural\\nnetwork algorithms, and will also have great impacts on object\\ndetection techniques which can be considered as learning\\nsystems. [11]–[14][S6]. However, due to large variations in\\nviewpoints, poses, occlusions and lighting conditions, it’s difﬁ-\\ncult to perfectly accomplish object detection with an additional\\nZhong-Qiu Zhao, Peng Zheng and Shou-Tao Xu are with the College of\\nComputer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technol-\\nogy, China.

So much attention has been attracted\\nto this ﬁeld in recent years [15]–[18].\\nThe problem deﬁnition of object detection is to determine\\nwhere objects are located in a given image (object localization)\\nand which category each object belongs to (object classiﬁca-\\ntion). So the pipeline of traditional object detection models\\ncan be mainly divided into three stages: informative region\\nselection, feature extraction and classiﬁcation.\\nInformative region selection. As different objects may appear\\nin any positions of the image and have different aspect ratios\\nor sizes, it is a natural choice to scan the whole image with a\\nmulti-scale sliding window. Although this exhaustive strategy\\ncan ﬁnd out all possible positions of the objects, its short-\\ncomings are also obvious. Due to a large number of candidate\\nwindows, it is computationally expensive and produces too\\nmany redundant windows. However, if only a ﬁxed number of\\nsliding window templates are applied, unsatisfactory regions\\nmay be produced.\\nFeature extraction. To recognize different objects, we need\\nto extract visual features which can provide a semantic and\\nrobust representation. SIFT [19], HOG [20] and Haar-like [21]\\nfeatures are the representative ones. This is due to the fact\\nthat these features can produce representations associated with\\ncomplex cells in human brain [19]. However, due to the diver-\\nsity of appearances, illumination conditions and backgrounds,\\nit’s difﬁcult to manually design a robust feature descriptor to\\nperfectly describe all kinds of objects.\\nClassiﬁcation. Besides, a classiﬁer is needed to distinguish\\na target object from all the other categories and to make the\\nrepresentations more hierarchical, semantic and informative\\nfor visual recognition. Usually, the Supported Vector Machine\\n(SVM) [22], AdaBoost [23] and Deformable Part-based Model\\n(DPM) [24] are good choices. Among these classiﬁers, the\\nDPM is a ﬂexible model by combining object parts with\\ndeformation cost to handle severe deformations. In DPM, with\\nthe aid of a graphical model, carefully designed low-level\\nfeatures and kinematically inspired part decompositions are\\ncombined. And discriminative learning of graphical models\\nallows for building high-precision part-based models for a\\nvariety of object classes.\\nBased on these discriminant local feature descriptors and\\nshallow learnable architectures, state of the art results have\\nbeen obtained on PASCAL VOC object detection competition\\n[25] and real-time embedded systems have been obtained with\\na low burden on hardware. However, small gains are obtained\\nduring 2010-2012 by only building ensemble systems and\\nemploying minor variants of successful methods [15]. This fact\\nis due to the following reasons: 1) The generation of candidate\\nbounding boxes with a sliding window strategy is redundant,\\ninefﬁcient and inaccurate. 2) The semantic gap cannot be\\narXiv:1807.05511v2  [cs.CV]  16 Apr 2019'),\n",

Based on basic CNN ar-\\nchitectures, generic object detection is achieved with bounding\\nbox regression, while salient object detection is accomplished\\nwith local contrast enhancement and pixel-level segmentation.\\nFace detection and pedestrian detection are closely related\\nto generic object detection and mainly accomplished with\\nmulti-scale adaption and multi-feature fusion/boosting forest,\\nrespectively. The dotted lines indicate that the corresponding\\ndomains are associated with each other under certain con-\\nditions. It should be noticed that the covered domains are\\ndiversiﬁed. Pedestrian and face images have regular structures,\\nwhile general objects and scene images have more complex\\nvariations in geometric structures and layouts. Therefore,\\ndifferent deep models are required by various images.\\nThere has been a relevant pioneer effort [34] which mainly\\nfocuses on relevant software tools to implement deep learning\\ntechniques for image classiﬁcation and object detection, but\\npays little attention on detailing speciﬁc algorithms. Different\\nfrom it, our work not only reviews deep learning based object\\ndetection models and algorithms covering different applica-\\ntion domains in detail, but also provides their corresponding\\nexperimental comparisons and meaningful analyses.\\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section\\n2, a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and the\\nbasic architecture of CNN is provided. Generic object detec-\\ntion architectures are presented in Section 3. Then reviews\\nof CNN applied in several speciﬁc tasks, including salient\\nobject detection, face detection and pedestrian detection, are\\nexhibited in Section 4-6, respectively. Several promising future\\ndirections are proposed in Section 7. At last, some concluding\\nremarks are presented in Section 8.\\nII. A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF DEEP LEARNING\\nPrior to overview on deep learning based object detection\\napproaches, we provide a review on the history of deep\\nlearning along with an introduction on the basic architecture\\nand advantages of CNN.\\nA. The History: Birth, Decline and Prosperity\\nDeep models can be referred to as neural networks with\\ndeep structures. The history of neural networks can date back\\nto 1940s [35], and the original intention was to simulate the\\nhuman brain system to solve general learning problems in a\\nprincipled way. It was popular in 1980s and 1990s with the\\nproposal of back-propagation algorithm by Hinton et al. [36].\\nHowever, due to the overﬁtting of training, lack of large scale\\ntraining data, limited computation power and insigniﬁcance\\nin performance compared with other machine learning tools,\\nneural networks fell out of fashion in early 2000s.\\nDeep learning has become popular since 2006 [37][S7] with\\na break through in speech recognition [38]. The recovery of\\ndeep learning can be attributed to the following factors.\\n• The emergence of large scale annotated training data, such\\nas ImageNet [39], to fully exhibit its very large learning\\ncapacity;\\n• Fast development of high performance parallel computing\\nsystems, such as GPU clusters;\\n• Signiﬁcant advances in the design of network structures\\nand training strategies. With unsupervised and layerwise\\npre-training guided by Auto-Encoder (AE) [40] or Re-\\nstricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [41], a good initializa-\\ntion is provided. With dropout and data augmentation, the\\noverﬁtting problem in training has been relieved [6], [42].\\nWith batch normalization (BN), the training of very deep\\nneural networks becomes quite efﬁcient [43]. Meanwhile,\\nvarious network structures, such as AlexNet [6], Overfeat\\n[44], GoogLeNet [45], VGG [46] and ResNet [47], have\\nbeen extensively studied to improve the performance.\\nWhat prompts deep learning to have a huge impact on the\\nentire academic community? It may owe to the contribution of\\nHinton’s group, whose continuous efforts have demonstrated\\nthat deep learning would bring a revolutionary breakthrough\\non grand challenges rather than just obvious improvements on\\nsmall datasets. Their success results from training a large CNN\\non 1.2 million labeled images together with a few techniques\\n[6] (e.g., ReLU operation [48] and ‘dropout’ regularization).\\nB. Architecture and Advantages of CNN\\nCNN is the most representative model of deep learning [26].\\nA typical CNN architecture, which is referred to as VGG16,'),\n",

Each layer of CNN is known as a\\nfeature map. The feature map of the input layer is a 3D matrix\\nof pixel intensities for different color channels (e.g. RGB). The\\nfeature map of any internal layer is an induced multi-channel\\nimage, whose ‘pixel’ can be viewed as a speciﬁc feature. Every\\nneuron is connected with a small portion of adjacent neurons\\nfrom the previous layer (receptive ﬁeld). Different types of\\ntransformations [6], [49], [50] can be conducted on feature\\nmaps, such as ﬁltering and pooling. Filtering (convolution)\\noperation convolutes a ﬁlter matrix (learned weights) with\\nthe values of a receptive ﬁeld of neurons and takes a non-\\nlinear function (such as sigmoid [51], ReLU) to obtain ﬁnal\\nresponses. Pooling operation, such as max pooling, average\\npooling, L2-pooling and local contrast normalization [52],\\nsummaries the responses of a receptive ﬁeld into one value\\nto produce more robust feature descriptions.\\nWith an interleave between convolution and pooling, an\\ninitial feature hierarchy is constructed, which can be ﬁne-tuned\\nin a supervised manner by adding several fully connected (FC)\\nlayers to adapt to different visual tasks. According to the tasks\\ninvolved, the ﬁnal layer with different activation functions [6]\\nis added to get a speciﬁc conditional probability for each\\noutput neuron. And the whole network can be optimized on\\nan objective function (e.g. mean squared error or cross-entropy\\nloss) via the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. The\\ntypical VGG16 has totally 13 convolutional (conv) layers, 3\\nfully connected layers, 3 max-pooling layers and a softmax\\nclassiﬁcation layer. The conv feature maps are produced by\\nconvoluting 3*3 ﬁlter windows, and feature map resolutions\\nare reduced with 2 stride max-pooling layers. An arbitrary test\\nimage of the same size as training samples can be processed\\nwith the trained network. Re-scaling or cropping operations\\nmay be needed if different sizes are provided [6].\\nThe advantages of CNN against traditional methods can be\\nsummarised as follows.\\n• Hierarchical feature representation, which is the multi-\\nlevel representations from pixel to high-level semantic fea-\\ntures learned by a hierarchical multi-stage structure [15],\\n[53], can be learned from data automatically and hidden\\nfactors of input data can be disentangled through multi-level\\nnonlinear mappings.\\n• Compared with traditional shallow models, a deeper\\narchitecture provides an exponentially increased expressive\\ncapability.\\n• The architecture of CNN provides an opportunity to\\njointly optimize several related tasks together (e.g. Fast R-\\nCNN combines classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\ninto a multi-task leaning manner).\\n• Beneﬁtting from the large learning capacity of deep\\nCNNs, some classical computer vision challenges can be\\nrecast as high-dimensional data transform problems and\\nsolved from a different viewpoint.\\nDue to these advantages, CNN has been widely applied\\ninto many research ﬁelds, such as image super-resolution\\nreconstruction [54], [55], image classiﬁcation [5], [56], im-\\nage retrieval [57], [58], face recognition [8][S5], pedestrian\\ndetection [59]–[61] and video analysis [62], [63].\\nIII. GENERIC OBJECT DETECTION\\nGeneric object detection aims at locating and classifying\\nexisting objects in any one image, and labeling them with\\nrectangular bounding boxes to show the conﬁdences of exis-\\ntence. The frameworks of generic object detection methods\\ncan mainly be categorized into two types (see Figure 2).\\nOne follows traditional object detection pipeline, generating\\nregion proposals at ﬁrst and then classifying each proposal into\\ndifferent object categories. The other regards object detection\\nas a regression or classiﬁcation problem, adopting a uniﬁed\\nframework to achieve ﬁnal results (categories and locations)\\ndirectly. The region proposal based methods mainly include\\nR-CNN [15], SPP-net [64], Fast R-CNN [16], Faster R-CNN\\n[18], R-FCN [65], FPN [66] and Mask R-CNN [67], some of\\nwhich are correlated with each other (e.g. SPP-net modiﬁes R-\\nCNN with a SPP layer). The regression/classiﬁcation based\\nmethods mainly includes MultiBox [68], AttentionNet [69],\\nG-CNN [70], YOLO [17], SSD [71], YOLOv2 [72], DSSD\\n[73] and DSOD [74]. The correlations between these two\\npipelines are bridged by the anchors introduced in Faster R-\\nCNN. Details of these methods are as follows.\\nA. Region Proposal Based Framework\\nThe region proposal based framework, a two-step process,\\nmatches the attentional mechanism of human brain to some\\nextent, which gives a coarse scan of the whole scenario ﬁrstly\\nand then focuses on regions of interest. Among the pre-related\\nworks [44], [75], [76], the most representative one is Overfeat\\n[44]. This model inserts CNN into sliding window method,\\nwhich predicts bounding boxes directly from locations of\\nthe topmost feature map after obtaining the conﬁdences of\\nunderlying object categories.\\n1) R-CNN: It is of signiﬁcance to improve the quality of\\ncandidate bounding boxes and to take a deep architecture to\\nextract high-level features. To solve these problems, R-CNN\\n[15] was proposed by Ross Girshick in 2014 and obtained a\\nmean average precision (mAP) of 53.3% with more than 30%\\nimprovement over the previous best result (DPM HSC [77]) on\\nPASCAL VOC 2012. Figure 3 shows the ﬂowchart of R-CNN,\\nwhich can be divided into three stages as follows.\\nRegion proposal generation. The R-CNN adopts selective\\nsearch [78] to generate about 2k region proposals for each\\nimage. The selective search method relies on simple bottom-up\\ngrouping and saliency cues to provide more accurate candidate\\nboxes of arbitrary sizes quickly and to reduce the searching\\nspace in object detection [24], [39].\\nCNN based deep feature extraction. In this stage, each\\nregion proposal is warped or cropped into a ﬁxed resolution\\nand the CNN module in [6] is utilized to extract a 4096-\\ndimensional feature as the ﬁnal representation. Due to large\\nlearning capacity, dominant expressive power and hierarchical\\nstructure of CNNs, a high-level, semantic and robust feature\\nrepresentation for each region proposal can be obtained.\\nClassiﬁcation and localization. With pre-trained category-\\nspeciﬁc linear SVMs for multiple classes, different region pro-\\nposals are scored on a set of positive regions and background\\n(negative) regions. The scored regions are then adjusted with'),\n",

The ﬂowchart of R-CNN [15], which consists of 3 stages: (1) extracts\\nbottom-up region proposals, (2) computes features for each proposal using a\\nCNN, and then (3) classiﬁes each region with class-speciﬁc linear SVMs.\\nbounding box regression and ﬁltered with a greedy non-\\nmaximum suppression (NMS) to produce ﬁnal bounding boxes\\nfor preserved object locations.\\nWhen there are scarce or insufﬁcient labeled data, pre-\\ntraining is usually conducted. Instead of unsupervised pre-\\ntraining [79], R-CNN ﬁrstly conducts supervised pre-training\\non ILSVRC, a very large auxiliary dataset, and then takes a\\ndomain-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning. This scheme has been adopted by\\nmost of subsequent approaches [16], [18].\\nIn spite of its improvements over traditional methods and\\nsigniﬁcance in bringing CNN into practical object detection,\\nthere are still some disadvantages.\\n• Due to the existence of FC layers, the CNN requires a\\nﬁxed-size (e.g., 227×227) input image, which directly leads\\nto the re-computation of the whole CNN for each evaluated\\nregion, taking a great deal of time in the testing period.\\n• Training of R-CNN is a multi-stage pipeline. At ﬁrst,\\na convolutional network (ConvNet) on object proposals is\\nﬁne-tuned. Then the softmax classiﬁer learned by ﬁne-\\ntuning is replaced by SVMs to ﬁt in with ConvNet features.\\nFinally, bounding-box regressors are trained.\\n• Training is expensive in space and time. Features are\\nextracted from different region proposals and stored on the\\ndisk. It will take a long time to process a relatively small\\ntraining set with very deep networks, such as VGG16. At the\\nsame time, the storage memory required by these features\\nshould also be a matter of concern.\\n• Although selective search can generate region proposals\\nwith relatively high recalls, the obtained region proposals\\nare still redundant and this procedure is time-consuming\\n(around 2 seconds to extract 2k region proposals).\\nTo solve these problems, many methods have been pro-\\nposed. GOP [80] takes a much faster geodesic based segmen-\\ntation to replace traditional graph cuts. MCG [81] searches\\ndifferent scales of the image for multiple hierarchical segmen-\\ntations and combinatorially groups different regions to produce\\nproposals. Instead of extracting visually distinct segments,\\nthe edge boxes method [82] adopts the idea that objects are\\nmore likely to exist in bounding boxes with fewer contours\\nstraggling their boundaries. Also some researches tried to\\nre-rank or reﬁne pre-extracted region proposals to remove\\nunnecessary ones and obtained a limited number of valuable\\nones, such as DeepBox [83] and SharpMask [84].\\nIn addition, there are some improvements to solve the\\nproblem of inaccurate localization. Zhang et al. [85] utilized\\na bayesian optimization based search algorithm to guide\\nthe regressions of different bounding boxes sequentially, and\\ntrained class-speciﬁc CNN classiﬁers with a structured loss\\nto penalize the localization inaccuracy explicitly. Saurabh\\nGupta et al. improved object detection for RGB-D images\\nwith semantically rich image and depth features [86], and\\nlearned a new geocentric embedding for depth images to\\nencode each pixel. The combination of object detectors and\\nsuperpixel classiﬁcation framework gains a promising result\\non semantic scene segmentation task. Ouyang et al. proposed\\na deformable deep CNN (DeepID-Net) [87] which introduces\\na novel deformation constrained pooling (def-pooling) layer\\nto impose geometric penalty on the deformation of various\\nobject parts and makes an ensemble of models with different\\nsettings. Lenc et al. [88] provided an analysis on the role\\nof proposal generation in CNN-based detectors and tried to\\nreplace this stage with a constant and trivial region generation\\nscheme. The goal is achieved by biasing sampling to match\\nthe statistics of the ground truth bounding boxes with K-means\\nclustering. However, more candidate boxes are required to\\nachieve comparable results to those of R-CNN.\\n2) SPP-net: FC layers must take a ﬁxed-size input. That’s\\nwhy R-CNN chooses to warp or crop each region proposal\\ninto the same size. However, the object may exist partly in\\nthe cropped region and unwanted geometric distortion may be\\nproduced due to the warping operation. These content losses or\\ndistortions will reduce recognition accuracy, especially when\\nthe scales of objects vary.\\nTo solve this problem, He et al. took the theory of spatial\\npyramid matching (SPM) [89], [90] into consideration and\\nproposed a novel CNN architecture named SPP-net [64]. SPM\\ntakes several ﬁner to coarser scales to partition the image into\\na number of divisions and aggregates quantized local features\\ninto mid-level representations.\\nThe architecture of SPP-net for object detection can be\\nfound in Figure 4. Different from R-CNN, SPP-net reuses\\nfeature maps of the 5-th conv layer (conv5) to project region'),\n",

The\\nfeasibility of the reusability of these feature maps is due to\\nthe fact that the feature maps not only involve the strength of\\nlocal responses, but also have relationships with their spatial\\npositions [64].

If the number\\nof feature maps in conv5 is 256, taking a 3-level pyramid,\\nthe ﬁnal feature vector for each region proposal obtained after\\nSPP layer has a dimension of 256 × (12 + 22 + 42) = 5376.\\nSPP-net not only gains better results with correct estimation\\nof different region proposals in their corresponding scales, but\\nalso improves detection efﬁciency in testing period with the\\nsharing of computation cost before SPP layer among different\\nproposals.\\n3) Fast R-CNN: Although SPP-net has achieved impressive\\nimprovements in both accuracy and efﬁciency over R-CNN,\\nit still has some notable drawbacks. SPP-net takes almost\\nthe same multi-stage pipeline as R-CNN, including feature\\nextraction, network ﬁne-tuning, SVM training and bounding-\\nbox regressor ﬁtting. So an additional expense on storage space\\nis still required. Additionally, the conv layers preceding the\\nSPP layer cannot be updated with the ﬁne-tuning algorithm\\nintroduced in [64]. As a result, an accuracy drop of very deep\\nnetworks is unsurprising. To this end, Girshick [16] introduced\\na multi-task loss on classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\nand proposed a novel CNN architecture named Fast R-CNN.\\nThe architecture of Fast R-CNN is exhibited in Figure 5.\\nSimilar to SPP-net, the whole image is processed with conv\\nlayers to produce feature maps. Then, a ﬁxed-length feature\\nvector is extracted from each region proposal with a region of\\ninterest (RoI) pooling layer. The RoI pooling layer is a special\\ncase of the SPP layer, which has only one pyramid level. Each\\nfeature vector is then fed into a sequence of FC layers before\\nﬁnally branching into two sibling output layers. One output\\nlayer is responsible for producing softmax probabilities for\\nall C + 1 categories (C object classes plus one ‘background’\\nclass) and the other output layer encodes reﬁned bounding-\\nbox positions with four real-valued numbers. All parameters\\nin these procedures (except the generation of region proposals)\\nare optimized via a multi-task loss in an end-to-end way.\\nThe multi-tasks loss L is deﬁned as below to jointly train\\nclassiﬁcation and bounding-box regression,\\nL(p, u, tu, v) = Lcls(p, u) + λ[u ≥1]Lloc(tu, v)\\n(1)\\nwhere Lcls(p, u) = −log pu calculates the log loss for ground\\ntruth class u and pu is driven from the discrete probability\\ndistribution p = (p0, · · · , pC) over the C +1 outputs from the\\nlast FC layer. Lloc(tu, v) is deﬁned over the predicted offsets\\ntu = (tu\\nx, tu\\ny, tu\\nw, tu\\nh) and ground-truth bounding-box regression\\ntargets v = (vx, vy, vw, vh), where x, y, w, h denote the two\\ncoordinates of the box center, width, and height, respectively.\\nEach tu adopts the parameter settings in [15] to specify an\\nobject proposal with a log-space height/width shift and scale-\\ninvariant translation. The Iverson bracket indicator function\\n[u ≥1] is employed to omit all background RoIs. To provide\\nmore robustness against outliers and eliminate the sensitivity\\nin exploding gradients, a smooth L1 loss is adopted to ﬁt\\nbounding-box regressors as below\\nLloc(tu, v) =\\nX\\ni∈x,y,w,h\\nsmoothL1(tu\\ni −vi)\\n(2)\\nwhere\\nsmoothL1(x) =\\n(\\n0.5x2\\nif |x| < 1\\n|x| −0.5\\notherwise\\n(3)\\nTo accelerate the pipeline of Fast R-CNN, another two tricks\\nare of necessity. On one hand, if training samples (i.e. RoIs)\\ncome from different images, back-propagation through the\\nSPP layer becomes highly inefﬁcient. Fast R-CNN samples\\nmini-batches hierarchically, namely N images sampled ran-\\ndomly at ﬁrst and then R/N RoIs sampled in each image,\\nwhere R represents the number of RoIs. Critically, computa-\\ntion and memory are shared by RoIs from the same image in\\nthe forward and backward pass. On the other hand, much time\\nis spent in computing the FC layers during the forward pass\\n[16]. The truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [91]\\ncan be utilized to compress large FC layers and to accelerate\\nthe testing procedure.\\nIn the Fast R-CNN, regardless of region proposal genera-\\ntion, the training of all network layers can be processed in\\na single-stage with a multi-task loss. It saves the additional\\nexpense on storage space, and improves both accuracy and\\nefﬁciency with more reasonable training schemes.\\n4) Faster R-CNN: Despite the attempt to generate candi-\\ndate boxes with biased sampling [88], state-of-the-art object\\ndetection networks mainly rely on additional methods, such as\\nselective search and Edgebox, to generate a candidate pool of\\nisolated region proposals. Region proposal computation is also\\na bottleneck in improving efﬁciency. To solve this problem,\\nRen et al. introduced an additional Region Proposal Network\\n(RPN) [18], [92], which acts in a nearly cost-free way by\\nsharing full-image conv features with detection network.\\nRPN is achieved with a fully-convolutional network, which\\nhas the ability to predict object bounds and scores at each\\nposition simultaneously. Similar to [78], RPN takes an image\\nof arbitrary size to generate a set of rectangular object propos-\\nals. RPN operates on a speciﬁc conv layer with the preceding\\nlayers shared with object detection network.'),\n",

This decomposition originates from pioneering\\nclassiﬁcation architectures (e.g. AlexNet [6] and VGG16 [46])\\nwhich consist of a convolutional subnetwork and several FC\\nlayers separated by a speciﬁc spatial pooling layer.\\nRecent state-of-the-art image classiﬁcation networks, such\\nas Residual Nets (ResNets) [47] and GoogLeNets [45], [93],\\nare fully convolutional.

However, it turns out to be\\ninferior with such a naive solution [47]. This inconsistence is\\ndue to the dilemma of respecting translation variance in object\\ndetection compared with increasing translation invariance in\\nimage classiﬁcation. In other words, shifting an object inside\\nan image should be indiscriminative in image classiﬁcation\\nwhile any translation of an object in a bounding box may\\nbe meaningful in object detection. A manual insertion of\\nthe RoI pooling layer into convolutions can break down\\ntranslation invariance at the expense of additional unshared\\nregion-wise layers. So Li et al. [65] proposed a region-based\\nfully convolutional networks (R-FCN, Fig. S2).\\nDifferent from Faster R-CNN, for each category, the last\\nconv layer of R-FCN produces a total of k2 position-sensitive\\nscore maps with a ﬁxed grid of k × k ﬁrstly and a position-\\nsensitive RoI pooling layer is then appended to aggregate the\\nresponses from these score maps. Finally, in each RoI, k2\\nposition-sensitive scores are averaged to produce a C + 1-d\\nvector and softmax responses across categories are computed.\\nAnother 4k2-d conv layer is appended to obtain class-agnostic\\nbounding boxes.\\nWith R-FCN, more powerful classiﬁcation networks can be\\nadopted to accomplish object detection in a fully-convolutional\\narchitecture by sharing nearly all the layers, and state-of-the-\\nart results are obtained on both PASCAL VOC and Microsoft\\nCOCO [94] datasets at a test speed of 170ms per image.\\n6) FPN: Feature pyramids built upon image pyramids\\n(featurized image pyramids) have been widely applied in\\nmany object detection systems to improve scale invariance\\n[24], [64] (Figure 7(a)). However, training time and memory\\nconsumption increase rapidly. To this end, some techniques\\ntake only a single input scale to represent high-level semantics\\nand increase the robustness to scale changes (Figure 7(b)),\\nand image pyramids are built at test time which results in\\nan inconsistency between train/test-time inferences [16], [18].\\nThe in-network feature hierarchy in a deep ConvNet produces\\nfeature maps of different spatial resolutions while introduces\\nlarge semantic gaps caused by different depths (Figure 7(c)).\\nTo avoid using low-level features, pioneer works [71], [95]\\nusually build the pyramid starting from middle layers or\\njust sum transformed feature responses, missing the higher-'),\n",

The Mask R-CNN framework for instance segmentation [67].\\nresolution maps of the feature hierarchy.\\nDifferent from these approaches, FPN [66] holds an ar-\\nchitecture with a bottom-up pathway, a top-down pathway\\nand several lateral connections to combine low-resolution and\\nsemantically strong features with high-resolution and seman-\\ntically weak features (Figure 7(d)). The bottom-up pathway,\\nwhich is the basic forward backbone ConvNet, produces a\\nfeature hierarchy by downsampling the corresponding feature\\nmaps with a stride of 2. The layers owning the same size of\\noutput maps are grouped into the same network stage and the\\noutput of the last layer of each stage is chosen as the reference\\nset of feature maps to build the following top-down pathway.\\nTo build the top-down pathway, feature maps from higher\\nnetwork stages are upsampled at ﬁrst and then enhanced with\\nthose of the same spatial size from the bottom-up pathway\\nvia lateral connections. A 1 × 1 conv layer is appended to\\nthe upsampled map to reduce channel dimensions and the\\nmergence is achieved by element-wise addition. Finally, a 3×3\\nconvolution is also appended to each merged map to reduce\\nthe aliasing effect of upsampling and the ﬁnal feature map is\\ngenerated. This process is iterated until the ﬁnest resolution\\nmap is generated.\\nAs feature pyramid can extract rich semantics from all\\nlevels and be trained end-to-end with all scales, state-of-the-\\nart representation can be obtained without sacriﬁcing speed\\nand memory. Meanwhile, FPN is independent of the backbone\\nCNN architectures and can be applied to different stages of\\nobject detection (e.g. region proposal generation) and to many\\nother computer vision tasks (e.g. instance segmentation).\\n7) Mask R-CNN: Instance segmentation [96] is a challeng-\\ning task which requires detecting all objects in an image and\\nsegmenting each instance (semantic segmentation [97]). These\\ntwo tasks are usually regarded as two independent processes.\\nAnd the multi-task scheme will create spurious edge and\\nexhibit systematic errors on overlapping instances [98]. To\\nsolve this problem, parallel to the existing branches in Faster\\nR-CNN for classiﬁcation and bounding box regression, the\\nMask R-CNN [67] adds a branch to predict segmentation\\nmasks in a pixel-to-pixel manner (Figure 8).\\nDifferent from the other two branches which are inevitably\\ncollapsed into short output vectors by FC layers, the segmen-\\ntation mask branch encodes an m × m mask to maintain the\\nexplicit object spatial layout. This kind of fully convolutional\\nrepresentation requires fewer parameters but is more accurate\\nthan that of [97]. Formally, besides the two losses in (1) for\\nclassiﬁcation and bounding box regression, an additional loss\\nfor segmentation mask branch is deﬁned to reach a multi-task\\nloss. An this loss is only associated with ground-truth class\\nand relies on the classiﬁcation branch to predict the category.\\nBecause RoI pooling, the core operation in Faster R-CNN,\\nperforms a coarse spatial quantization for feature extraction,\\nmisalignment is introduced between the RoI and the features.\\nIt affects classiﬁcation little because of its robustness to small\\ntranslations. However, it has a large negative effect on pixel-\\nto-pixel mask prediction. To solve this problem, Mask R-CNN\\nadopts a simple and quantization-free layer, namely RoIAlign,\\nto preserve the explicit per-pixel spatial correspondence faith-\\nfully. RoIAlign is achieved by replacing the harsh quantization\\nof RoI pooling with bilinear interpolation [99], computing the\\nexact values of the input features at four regularly sampled\\nlocations in each RoI bin. In spite of its simplicity, this\\nseemingly minor change improves mask accuracy greatly,\\nespecially under strict localization metrics.\\nGiven the Faster R-CNN framework, the mask branch only\\nadds a small computational burden and its cooperation with\\nother tasks provides complementary information for object\\ndetection. As a result, Mask R-CNN is simple to implement\\nwith promising instance segmentation and object detection\\nresults. In a word, Mask R-CNN is a ﬂexible and efﬁcient\\nframework for instance-level recognition, which can be easily\\ngeneralized to other tasks (e.g. human pose estimation [7][S4])\\nwith minimal modiﬁcation.\\n8) Multi-task Learning, Multi-scale Representation and\\nContextual Modelling:\\nAlthough the Faster R-CNN gets\\npromising results with several hundred proposals, it still strug-\\ngles in small-size object detection and localization, mainly due\\nto the coarseness of its feature maps and limited information\\nprovided in particular candidate boxes. The phenomenon is\\nmore obvious on the Microsoft COCO dataset which consists\\nof objects at a broad range of scales, less prototypical images,\\nand requires more precise localization. To tackle these prob-\\nlems, it is of necessity to accomplish object detection with\\nmulti-task learning [100], multi-scale representation [95] and\\ncontext modelling [101] to combine complementary informa-\\ntion from multiple sources.\\nMulti-task Learning learns a useful representation for\\nmultiple correlated tasks from the same input [102], [103].\\nBrahmbhatt et al. introduced conv features trained for ob-\\nject segmentation and ‘stuff’ (amorphous categories such as\\nground and water) to guide accurate object detection of small\\nobjects (StuffNet) [100]. Dai et al. [97] presented Multitask\\nNetwork Cascades of three networks, namely class-agnostic\\nregion proposal generation, pixel-level instance segmentation\\nand regional instance classiﬁcation. Li et al. incorporated the\\nweakly-supervised object segmentation cues and region-based\\nobject detection into a multi-stage architecture to fully exploit\\nthe learned segmentation features [104].\\nMulti-scale Representation combines activations from\\nmultiple layers with skip-layer connections to provide seman-\\ntic information of different spatial resolutions [66]. Cai et\\nal. proposed the MS-CNN [105] to ease the inconsistency\\nbetween the sizes of objects and receptive ﬁelds with multiple\\nscale-independent output layers. Yang et al. investigated two\\nstrategies, namely scale-dependent pooling (SDP) and layer-\\nwise cascaded rejection classiﬁers (CRC), to exploit appropri-\\nate scale-dependent conv features [33].

Zagoruyko et al. proposed the MultiPath\\narchitecture by introducing three modiﬁcations to the Fast\\nR-CNN [112], including multi-scale skip connections [95],\\na modiﬁed foveal structure [110] and a novel loss function\\nsumming different IoU losses.\\n9) Thinking in Deep Learning based Object Detection:\\nApart from the above approaches, there are still many impor-\\ntant factors for continued progress.\\nThere is a large imbalance between the number of annotated\\nobjects and background examples. To address this problem,\\nShrivastava et al. proposed an effective online mining algo-\\nrithm (OHEM) [113] for automatic selection of the hard ex-\\namples, which leads to a more effective and efﬁcient training.\\nInstead of concentrating on feature extraction, Ren et al.\\nmade a detailed analysis on object classiﬁers [114], and\\nfound that it is of particular importance for object detection\\nto construct a deep and convolutional per-region classiﬁer\\ncarefully, especially for ResNets [47] and GoogLeNets [45].\\nTraditional CNN framework for object detection is not\\nskilled in handling signiﬁcant scale variation, occlusion or\\ntruncation, especially when only 2D object detection is in-\\nvolved. To address this problem, Xiang et al. proposed a\\nnovel subcategory-aware region proposal network [60], which\\nguides the generation of region proposals with subcategory\\ninformation related to object poses and jointly optimize object\\ndetection and subcategory classiﬁcation.\\nOuyang et al. found that the samples from different classes\\nfollow a longtailed distribution [115], which indicates that dif-\\nferent classes with distinct numbers of samples have different\\ndegrees of impacts on feature learning. To this end, objects are\\nﬁrstly clustered into visually similar class groups, and then a\\nhierarchical feature learning scheme is adopted to learn deep\\nrepresentations for each group separately.\\nIn order to minimize computational cost and achieve the\\nstate-of-the-art performance, with the ‘deep and thin’ design\\nprinciple and following the pipeline of Fast R-CNN, Hong et\\nal. proposed the architecture of PVANET [116], which adopts\\nsome building blocks including concatenated ReLU [117],\\nInception [45], and HyperNet [101] to reduce the expense on\\nmulti-scale feature extraction and trains the network with batch\\nnormalization [43], residual connections [47], and learning\\nrate scheduling based on plateau detection [47]. The PVANET\\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance and can be processed\\nin real time on Titan X GPU (21 FPS).\\nB. Regression/Classiﬁcation Based Framework\\nRegion proposal based frameworks are composed of sev-\\neral correlated stages, including region proposal generation,\\nfeature extraction with CNN, classiﬁcation and bounding box\\nregression, which are usually trained separately. Even in recent\\nend-to-end module Faster R-CNN, an alternative training is\\nstill required to obtain shared convolution parameters between\\nRPN and detection network.

We ﬁrstly reviews some pioneer CNN\\nmodels, and then focus on two signiﬁcant frameworks,\\nnamely You only look once (YOLO) [17] and Single Shot\\nMultiBox Detector (SSD) [71].\\n1) Pioneer Works: Previous to YOLO and SSD, many\\nresearchers have already tried to model object detection as\\na regression or classiﬁcation task.\\nSzegedy et al. formulated object detection task as a DNN-\\nbased regression [118], generating a binary mask for the\\ntest image and extracting detections with a simple bounding\\nbox inference. However, the model has difﬁculty in handling\\noverlapping objects, and bounding boxes generated by direct\\nupsampling is far from perfect.\\nPinheiro et al. proposed a CNN model with two branches:\\none generates class agnostic segmentation masks and the\\nother predicts the likelihood of a given patch centered on\\nan object [119].

[17] proposed a novel framework\\ncalled YOLO, which makes use of the whole topmost feature\\nmap to predict both conﬁdences for multiple categories and\\nbounding boxes. The basic idea of YOLO is exhibited in\\nFigure 9. YOLO divides the input image into an S × S grid and\\neach grid cell is responsible for predicting the object centered\\nin that grid cell. Each grid cell predicts B bounding boxes\\nand their corresponding conﬁdence scores. Formally, conﬁ-\\ndence scores are deﬁned as Pr(Object) ∗IOU truth\\npred , which\\nindicates how likely there exist objects (Pr(Object) ≥0) and\\nshows conﬁdences of its prediction (IOU truth\\npred ).

Furthermore,\\nYOLO produces fewer false positives on background, which\\nmakes the cooperation with Fast R-CNN become possible. An\\nimproved version, YOLOv2, was later proposed in [72], which\\nadopts several impressive strategies, such as BN, anchor boxes,\\ndimension cluster and multi-scale training.\\n3) SSD: YOLO has a difﬁculty in dealing with small\\nobjects in groups, which is caused by strong spatial constraints\\nimposed on bounding box predictions [17]. Meanwhile, YOLO\\nstruggles to generalize to objects in new/unusual aspect ratios/\\nconﬁgurations and produces relatively coarse features due to\\nmultiple downsampling operations.\\nAiming at these problems, Liu et al. proposed a Single Shot\\nMultiBox Detector (SSD) [71], which was inspired by the\\nanchors adopted in MultiBox [68], RPN [18] and multi-scale\\nrepresentation [95]. Given a speciﬁc feature map, instead of\\nﬁxed grids adopted in YOLO, the SSD takes advantage of a set\\nof default anchor boxes with different aspect ratios and scales\\nto discretize the output space of bounding boxes. To handle\\nobjects with various sizes, the network fuses predictions from\\nmultiple feature maps with different resolutions .\\nThe architecture of SSD is demonstrated in Figure 10.

The evaluation terms\\nare Average Precision (AP) in each single category and mean\\nAverage Precision (mAP) across all the 20 categories. Com-\\nparative results are exhibited in Table II and III, from which\\nthe following remarks can be obtained.\\n• If incorporated with a proper way, more powerful back-\\nbone CNN models can deﬁnitely improve object detection\\nperformance (the comparison among R-CNN with AlexNet,\\nR-CNN with VGG16 and SPP-net with ZF-Net [122]).\\n• With the introduction of SPP layer (SPP-net), end-to-\\nend multi-task architecture (FRCN) and RPN (Faster R-\\nCNN), object detection performance is improved gradually\\nand apparently.\\n• Due to large quantities of trainable parameters, in order to\\nobtain multi-level robust features, data augmentation is very\\nimportant for deep learning based models (Faster R-CNN\\nwith ‘07’ ,‘07+12’ and ‘07+12+coco’).\\n• Apart from basic models, there are still many other factors\\naffecting object detection performance, such as multi-scale\\nand multi-region feature extraction (e.g. MR-CNN), modi-\\nﬁed classiﬁcation networks (e.g. NOC), additional informa-\\ntion from other correlated tasks (e.g. StuffNet, HyperNet),\\nmulti-scale representation (e.g. ION) and mining of hard\\nnegative samples (e.g. OHEM).\\n• As YOLO is not skilled in producing object localizations\\nof high IoU, it obtains a very poor result on VOC 2012.\\nHowever, with the complementary information from Fast\\nR-CNN (YOLO+FRCN) and the aid of other strategies,\\nsuch as anchor boxes, BN and ﬁne grained features, the\\nlocalization errors are corrected (YOLOv2).\\n• By combining many recent tricks and modelling the whole\\nnetwork as a fully convolutional one, R-FCN achieves a\\nmore obvious improvement of detection performance over\\nother approaches.\\n2) Microsoft COCO: Microsoft COCO is composed of\\n300,000 fully segmented images, in which each image has\\nan average of 7 object instances from a total of 80 categories.\\nAs there are a lot of less iconic objects with a broad range\\nof scales and a stricter requirement on object localization,\\nthis dataset is more challenging than PASCAL 2012. Object\\ndetection performance is evaluated by AP computed under\\ndifferent degrees of IoUs and on different object sizes. The\\nresults are shown in Table IV.\\nBesides similar remarks to those of PASCAL VOC, some\\nother conclusions can be drawn as follows from Table IV.\\n• Multi-scale training and test are beneﬁcial in improv-\\ning object detection performance, which provide additional\\ninformation in different resolutions (R-FCN). FPN and\\nDSSD provide some better ways to build feature pyramids\\nto achieve multi-scale representation. The complementary\\ninformation from other related tasks is also helpful for\\naccurate object localization (Mask R-CNN with instance\\nsegmentation task).\\n•\\nOverall,\\nregion\\nproposal\\nbased\\nmethods,\\nsuch\\nas\\nFaster R-CNN and R-FCN, perform better than regres-\\nsion/classﬁcation based approaches, namely YOLO and\\nSSD, due to the fact that quite a lot of localization errors\\nare produced by regression/classﬁcation based approaches.\\n• Context modelling is helpful to locate small objects,\\nwhich provides additional information by consulting nearby\\nobjects and surroundings (GBD-Net and multi-path).\\n• Due to the existence of a large number of nonstandard\\nsmall objects, the results on this dataset are much worse\\nthan those of VOC 2007/2012. With the introduction of\\nother powerful frameworks (e.g. ResNeXt [123]) and useful\\nstrategies (e.g. multi-task learning [67], [124]), the perfor-\\nmance can be improved.\\n• The success of DSOD in training from scratch stresses the\\nimportance of network design to release the requirements\\nfor perfect pre-trained classiﬁers on relevant tasks and large\\nnumbers of annotated samples.\\n3) Timing Analysis: Timing analysis (Table V) is conducted\\non Intel i7-6700K CPU with a single core and NVIDIA Titan'),\n",

SALIENT OBJECT DETECTION\\nVisual saliency detection, one of the most important and\\nchallenging tasks in computer vision, aims to highlight the\\nmost dominant object regions in an image. Numerous ap-\\nplications incorporate the visual saliency to improve their\\nperformance, such as image cropping [125] and segmentation\\n[126], image retrieval [57] and object detection [66].\\nBroadly, there are two branches of approaches in salient\\nobject detection, namely bottom-up (BU) [127] and top-down\\n(TD) [128]. Local feature contrast plays the central role in BU\\nsalient object detection, regardless of the semantic contents of\\nthe scene. To learn local feature contrast, various local and\\nglobal features are extracted from pixels, e.g. edges [129],\\nspatial information [130]. However, high-level and multi-scale\\nsemantic information cannot be explored with these low-level\\nfeatures. As a result, low contrast salient maps instead of\\nsalient objects are obtained. TD salient object detection is task-\\noriented and takes prior knowledge about object categories\\nto guide the generation of salient maps. Taking semantic\\nsegmentation as an example, a saliency map is generated in the\\nsegmentation to assign pixels to particular object categories via\\na TD approach [131]. In a word, TD saliency can be viewed\\nas a focus-of-attention mechanism, which prunes BU salient\\npoints that are unlikely to be parts of the object [132].\\nA. Deep learning in Salient Object Detection\\nDue to the signiﬁcance for providing high-level and multi-\\nscale feature representation and the successful applications\\nin many correlated computer vision tasks, such as semantic\\nsegmentation [131], edge detection [133] and generic object\\ndetection [16], it is feasible and necessary to extend CNN to\\nsalient object detection.\\nThe early work by Eleonora Vig et al. [28] follows a\\ncompletely automatic data-driven approach to perform a large-\\nscale search for optimal features, namely an ensemble of deep\\nnetworks with different layers and parameters. To address the\\nproblem of limited training data, Kummerer et al. proposed the\\nDeep Gaze [134] by transferring from the AlexNet to generate\\na high dimensional feature space and create a saliency map. A\\nsimilar architecture was proposed by Huang et al. to integrate\\nsaliency prediction into pre-trained object recognition DNNs\\n[135]. The transfer is accomplished by ﬁne-tuning DNNs’\\nweights with an objective function based on the saliency\\nevaluation metrics, such as Similarity, KL-Divergence and\\nNormalized Scanpath Saliency.\\nSome works combined local and global visual clues to\\nimprove salient object detection performance. Wang et al.\\ntrained two independent deep CNNs (DNN-L and DNN-G)\\nto capture local information and global contrast and predicted\\nsaliency maps by integrating both local estimation and global\\nsearch [136]. Cholakkal et al. proposed a weakly supervised\\nsaliency detection framework to combine visual saliency from\\nbottom-up and top-down saliency maps, and reﬁned the results\\nwith a multi-scale superpixel-averaging [137]. Zhao et al.\\nproposed a multi-context deep learning framework, which\\nutilizes a uniﬁed learning framework to model global and\\nlocal context jointly with the aid of superpixel segmentation\\n[138]. To predict saliency in videos, Bak et al. fused two\\nstatic saliency models, namely spatial stream net and tem-\\nporal stream net, into a two-stream framework with a novel\\nempirically grounded data augmentation technique [139].\\nComplementary information from semantic segmentation\\nand context modeling is beneﬁcial. To learn internal represen-\\ntations of saliency efﬁciently, He et al. proposed a novel su-\\nperpixelwise CNN approach called SuperCNN [140], in which\\nsalient object detection is formulated as a binary labeling\\nproblem. Based on a fully convolutional neural network, Li\\net al. proposed a multi-task deep saliency model, in which\\nintrinsic correlations between saliency detection and semantic\\nsegmentation are set up [141]. However, due to the conv layers\\nwith large receptive ﬁelds and pooling layers, blurry object\\nboundaries and coarse saliency maps are produced. Tang et\\nal. proposed a novel saliency detection framework (CRPSD)\\n[142], which combines region-level saliency estimation and\\npixel-level saliency prediction together with three closely\\nrelated CNNs. Li et al. proposed a deep contrast network\\nto combine segment-wise spatial pooling and pixel-level fully\\nconvolutional streams [143].\\nThe proper integration of multi-scale feature maps is also\\nof signiﬁcance for improving detection performance. Based\\non Fast R-CNN, Wang et al. proposed the RegionNet by\\nperforming salient object detection with end-to-end edge pre-\\nserving and multi-scale contextual modelling [144]. Liu et al.\\n[27] proposed a multi-resolution convolutional neural network\\n(Mr-CNN) to predict eye ﬁxations, which is achieved by\\nlearning both bottom-up visual saliency and top-down visual\\nfactors from raw image data simultaneously. Cornia et al.\\nproposed an architecture which combines features extracted at\\ndifferent levels of the CNN [145]. Li et al. proposed a multi-\\nscale deep CNN framework to extract three scales of deep\\ncontrast features [146], namely the mean-subtracted region,\\nthe bounding box of its immediate neighboring regions and\\nthe masked entire image, from each candidate region.\\nIt is efﬁcient and accurate to train a direct pixel-wise\\nCNN architecture to predict salient objects with the aids of\\nRNNs and deconvolution networks. Pan et al. formulated\\nsaliency prediction as a minimization optimization on the\\nEuclidean distance between the predicted saliency map and\\nthe ground truth and proposed two kinds of architectures\\n[147]: a shallow one trained from scratch and a deeper one\\nadapted from deconvoluted VGG network. As convolutional-\\ndeconvolution networks are not expert in recognizing objects\\nof multiple scales, Kuen et al. proposed a recurrent attentional\\nconvolutional-deconvolution network (RACDNN) with several\\nspatial transformer and recurrent network units to conquer\\nthis problem [148]. To fuse local, global and contextual\\ninformation of salient objects, Tang et al. developed a deeply-\\nsupervised recurrent convolutional neural network (DSRCNN)\\nto perform a full image-to-image saliency detection [149].'),\n",

Experimental Evaluation\\nFour representative datasets, including ECSSD [156], HKU-\\nIS [146], PASCALS [157], and SOD [158], are used to\\nevaluate several state-of-the-art methods. ECSSD consists of\\n1000 structurally complex but semantically meaningful natural\\nimages. HKU-IS is a large-scale dataset containing over 4000\\nchallenging images. Most of these images have more than\\none salient object and own low contrast. PASCALS is a\\nsubset chosen from the validation set of PASCAL VOC 2010\\nsegmentation dataset and is composed of 850 natural images.\\nThe SOD dataset possesses 300 images containing multiple\\nsalient objects. The training and validation sets for different\\ndatasets are kept the same as those in [152].\\nTwo standard metrics, namely F-measure and the mean\\nabsolute error (MAE), are utilized to evaluate the quality of a\\nsaliency map. Given precision and recall values pre-computed\\non the union of generated binary mask B and ground truth Z,\\nF-measure is deﬁned as below\\nFβ = (1 + β2)Presion × Recall\\nβ2Presion + Recall\\n(7)\\nwhere β2 is set to 0.3 in order to stress the importance of the\\nprecision value.\\nThe MAE score is computed with the following equation\\nMAE =\\n1\\nH × W\\nH\\nX\\ni=1\\nW\\nX\\nj=1\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c ˆS(i, j) = ˆZ(i, j)\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\n(8)\\nwhere ˆZ and ˆS represent the ground truth and the continuous\\nsaliency map, respectively. W and H are the width and\\nheight of the salient area, respectively. This score stresses\\nthe importance of successfully detected salient objects over\\ndetected non-salient pixels [159].\\nThe following approaches are evaluated: CHM [150], RC\\n[151], DRFI [152], MC [138], MDF [146], LEGS [136], DSR\\n[149], MTDNN [141], CRPSD [142], DCL [143], ELD [153],\\nNLDF [154] and DSSC [155]. Among these methods, CHM,\\nRC and DRFI are classical ones with the best performance\\n[159], while the other methods are all associated with CNN.\\nF-measure and MAE scores are shown in Table VI.\\nFrom Table VI, we can ﬁnd that CNN based methods\\nperform better than classic methods. MC and MDF combine\\nthe information from local and global context to reach a\\nmore accurate saliency. ELD refers to low-level handcrafted\\nfeatures for complementary information. LEGS adopts generic\\nregion proposals to provide initial salient regions, which may\\nbe insufﬁcient for salient detection. DSR and MT act in\\ndifferent ways by introducing recurrent network and semantic\\nsegmentation, which provide insights for future improvements.\\nCPRSD, DCL, NLDF and DSSC are all based on multi-scale\\nrepresentations and superpixel segmentation, which provide\\nrobust salient regions and smooth boundaries. DCL, NLDF\\nand DSSC perform the best on these four datasets. DSSC\\nearns the best performance by modelling scale-to-scale short-\\nconnections.\\nOverall, as CNN mainly provides salient information in\\nlocal regions, most of CNN based methods need to model\\nvisual saliency along region boundaries with the aid of su-\\nperpixel segmentation. Meanwhile, the extraction of multi-\\nscale deep CNN features is of signiﬁcance for measuring local\\nconspicuity. Finally, it’s necessary to strengthen local con-\\nnections between different CNN layers and as well to utilize\\ncomplementary information from local and global context.\\nV. FACE DETECTION\\nFace detection is essential to many face applications and acts\\nas an important pre-processing procedure to face recognition\\n[160]–[162], face synthesis [163], [164] and facial expression\\nanalysis [165]. Different from generic object detection, this\\ntask is to recognize and locate face regions covering a very\\nlarge range of scales (30-300 pts vs. 10-1000 pts). At the same\\ntime, faces have their unique object structural conﬁgurations\\n(e.g. the distribution of different face parts) and characteristics\\n(e.g. skin color). All these differences lead to special attention\\nto this task. However, large visual variations of faces, such as\\nocclusions, pose variations and illumination changes, impose\\ngreat challenges for this task in real applications.\\nThe most famous face detector proposed by Viola and\\nJones [166] trains cascaded classiﬁers with Haar-Like features\\nand AdaBoost, achieving good performance with real-time\\nefﬁciency. However, this detector may degrade signiﬁcantly\\nin real-world applications due to larger visual variations of\\nhuman faces. Different from this cascade structure, Felzen-\\nszwalb et al. proposed a deformable part model (DPM) for face\\ndetection [24]. However, for these traditional face detection\\nmethods, high computational expenses and large quantities\\nof annotations are required to achieve a reasonable result.\\nBesides, their performance is greatly restricted by manually\\ndesigned features and shallow architecture.\\nA. Deep learning in Face Detection\\nRecently, some CNN based face detection approaches have\\nbeen proposed [167]–[169].As less accurate localization re-\\nsults from independent regressions of object coordinates, Yu\\net al. [167] proposed a novel IoU loss function for predicting\\nthe four bounds of box jointly. Farfade et al. [168] proposed a\\nDeep Dense Face Detector (DDFD) to conduct multi-view face\\ndetection, which is able to detect faces in a wide range of ori-\\nentations without requirement of pose/landmark annotations.\\nYang et al. proposed a novel deep learning based face detection\\nframework [169], which collects the responses from local fa-\\ncial parts (e.g. eyes, nose and mouths) to address face detection\\nunder severe occlusions and unconstrained pose variations.\\nYang et al. [170] proposed a scale-friendly detection network\\nnamed ScaleFace, which splits a large range of target scales\\ninto smaller sub-ranges. Different specialized sub-networks are\\nconstructed on these sub-scales and combined into a single\\none to conduct end-to-end optimization. Hao et al. designed an\\nefﬁcient CNN to predict the scale distribution histogram of the\\nfaces and took this histogram to guide the zoom-in and zoom-\\nout of the image [171]. Since the faces are approximately\\nin uniform scale after zoom, compared with other state-of-\\nthe-art baselines, better performance is achieved with less\\ncomputation cost. Besides, some generic detection frameworks'),\n",

Yang et al. proposed a three-stage\\ncascade structure based on FCNs [8], while in each stage, a\\nmulti-scale FCN is utilized to reﬁne the positions of possible\\nfaces. Qin et al. proposed a uniﬁed framework which achieves\\nbetter results with the complementary information from dif-\\nferent jointly trained CNNs [178].\\nB.

The perfor-\\nmance can be improved by the following strategies: designing\\nnovel optimization loss, modifying generic detection pipelines,\\nbuilding meaningful network cascades, adapting scale-aware\\ndetection and learning multi-task shared CNN features.\\nVI. PEDESTRIAN DETECTION\\nRecently, pedestrian detection has been intensively studied,\\nwhich has a close relationship to pedestrian tracking [189],\\n[190], person re-identiﬁcation [191], [192] and robot naviga-\\ntion [193], [194]. Prior to the recent progress in DCNN based\\nmethods [195], [196], some researchers combined boosted\\ndecision forests with hand-crafted features to obtain pedestrian\\ndetectors [197]–[199]. At the same time, to explicitly model\\nthe deformation and occlusion, part-based models [200] and\\nexplicit occlusion handling [201], [202] are of concern.\\nAs there are many pedestrian instances of small sizes\\nin typical scenarios of pedestrian detection (e.g. automatic\\ndriving and intelligent surveillance), the application of RoI\\npooling layer in generic object detection pipeline may result\\nin ‘plain’ features due to collapsing bins. In the meantime, the\\nmain source of false predictions in pedestrian detection is the\\nconfusion of hard background instances, which is in contrast\\nto the interference from multiple categories in generic object\\ndetection. As a result, different conﬁgurations and components\\nare required to accomplish accurate pedestrian detection.\\nA. Deep learning in Pedestrian Detection\\nAlthough DCNNs have obtained excellent performance on\\ngeneric object detection [16], [72], none of these approaches\\nhave achieved better results than the best hand-crafted feature\\nbased method [198] for a long time, even when part-based\\ninformation and occlusion handling are incorporated [202].\\nThereby, some researches have been conducted to analyze the\\nreasons. Zhang et al. attempted to adapt generic Faster R-CNN\\n[18] to pedestrian detection [203]. They modiﬁed the down-\\nstream classiﬁer by adding boosted forests to shared, high-\\nresolution conv feature maps and taking a RPN to handle small\\ninstances and hard negative examples. To deal with complex\\nocclusions existing in pedestrian images, inspired by DPM\\n[24], Tian et al. proposed a deep learning framework called\\nDeepParts [204], which makes decisions based an ensemble of\\nextensive part detectors. DeepParts has advantages in dealing\\nwith weakly labeled data, low IoU positive proposals and\\npartial occlusion.\\nOther researchers also tried to combine complementary in-\\nformation from multiple data sources. CompACT-Deep adopts\\na complexity-aware cascade to combine hand-crafted features\\nand ﬁne-tuned DCNNs [195]. Based on Faster R-CNN, Liu et\\nal. proposed multi-spectral deep neural networks for pedestrian\\ndetection to combine complementary information from color\\nand thermal images [205]. Tian et al. [206] proposed a task-\\nassistant CNN (TA-CNN) to jointly learn multiple tasks with\\nTABLE VII\\nDETAILED BREAKDOWN PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS OF\\nSTATE-OF-THE-ART MODELS ON CALTECH PEDESTRIAN DATASET.

Du et al. proposed\\na deep neural network fusion architecture for fast and robust\\npedestrian detection [207]. Based on the candidate bounding\\nboxes generated with SSD detectors [71], multiple binary\\nclassiﬁers are processed parallelly to conduct soft-rejection\\nbased network fusion (SNF) by consulting their aggregated\\ndegree of conﬁdences.\\nHowever, most of these approaches are much more sophisti-\\ncated than the standard R-CNN framework. CompACT-Deep\\nconsists of a variety of hand-crafted features, a small CNN\\nmodel and a large VGG16 model [195]. DeepParts contains\\n45 ﬁne-tuned DCNN models, and a set of strategies, including\\nbounding box shifting handling and part selection, are required\\nto arrive at the reported results [204]. So the modiﬁcation and\\nsimpliﬁcation is of signiﬁcance to reduce the burden on both\\nsoftware and hardware to satisfy real-time detection demand.\\nTome et al. proposed a novel solution to adapt generic object\\ndetection pipeline to pedestrian detection by optimizing most\\nof its stages [59]. Hu et al. [208] trained an ensemble of\\nboosted decision models by reusing the conv feature maps, and\\na further improvement was gained with simple pixel labelling\\nand additional complementary hand-crafted features.

The ﬁrst two methods are based\\non hand-crafted features while the rest ones rely on deep CNN\\nfeatures. All results are exhibited in Table VII. From this table,\\nwe observe that different from other tasks, classic handcrafted\\nfeatures can still earn competitive results with boosted decision\\nforests [203], ACF [197] and HOG+LUV channels [S2]. As\\nan early attempt to adapt CNN to pedestrian detection, the\\nfeatures generated by SCF+AlexNet are not so discriminant\\nand produce relatively poor results. Based on multiple CNNs,\\nDeepParts and CompACT-Deep accomplish detection tasks via\\ndifferent strategies, namely local part integration and cascade\\nnetwork. The responses from different local part detectors\\nmake DeepParts robust to partial occlusions. However, due to\\ncomplexity, it is too time-consuming to achieve real-time de-\\ntection. The multi-scale representation of MS-CNN improves\\naccuracy of pedestrian locations. SA-FastRCNN extends Fast\\nR-CNN to automatically detecting pedestrians according to\\ntheir different scales, which has trouble when there are partial\\nocclusions. RPN+BF combines the detectors produced by\\nFaster R-CNN with boosting decision forest to accurately\\nlocate different pedestrians. F-DNN+SS, which is composed\\nof multiple parallel classiﬁers with soft rejections, performs\\nthe best followed by RPN+BF, SA-FastRCNN and MS-CNN.\\nIn short, CNN based methods can provide more accurate\\ncandidate boxes and multi-level semantic information for\\nidentifying and locating pedestrians. Meanwhile, handcrafted\\nfeatures are complementary and can be combined with CNN\\nto achieve better results. The improvements over existing CNN\\nmethods can be obtained by carefully designing the framework\\nand classiﬁers, extracting multi-scale and part based semantic\\ninformation and searching for complementary information\\nfrom other related tasks, such as segmentation.\\nVII. PROMISING FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND TASKS\\nIn spite of rapid development and achieved promising\\nprogress of object detection, there are still many open issues\\nfor future work.\\nThe ﬁrst one is small object detection such as occurring\\nin COCO dataset and in face detection task. To improve\\nlocalization accuracy on small objects under partial occlusions,\\nit is necessary to modify network architectures from the\\nfollowing aspects.\\n• Multi-task joint optimization and multi-modal infor-\\nmation fusion. Due to the correlations between different\\ntasks within and outside object detection, multi-task joint\\noptimization has already been studied by many researchers\\n[16] [18]. However, apart from the tasks mentioned in\\nSubs. III-A8, it is desirable to think over the characteristics\\nof different sub-tasks of object detection (e.g. superpixel\\nsemantic segmentation in salient object detection) and ex-\\ntend multi-task optimization to other applications such as\\ninstance segmentation [66], multi-object tracking [202] and\\nmulti-person pose estimation [S4]. Besides, given a speciﬁc\\napplication, the information from different modalities, such\\nas text [212], thermal data [205] and images [65], can be\\nfused together to achieve a more discriminant network.\\n• Scale adaption. Objects usually exist in different scales,\\nwhich is more apparent in face detection and pedestrian\\ndetection. To increase the robustness to scale changes, it\\nis demanded to train scale-invariant, multi-scale or scale-\\nadaptive detectors. For scale-invariant detectors, more pow-\\nerful backbone architectures (e.g. ResNext [123]), negative\\nsample mining [113], reverse connection [213] and sub-\\ncategory modelling [60] are all beneﬁcial. For multi-scale\\ndetectors, both the FPN [66] which produces multi-scale\\nfeature maps and Generative Adversarial Network [214]\\nwhich narrows representation differences between small ob-\\njects and the large ones with a low-cost architecture provide\\ninsights into generating meaningful feature pyramid. For\\nscale-adaptive detectors, it is useful to combine knowledge\\ngraph [215], attentional mechanism [216], cascade network\\n[180] and scale distribution estimation [171] to detect ob-\\njects adaptively.\\n• Spatial correlations and contextual modelling. Spatial\\ndistribution plays an important role in object detection. So\\nregion proposal generation and grid regression are taken\\nto obtain probable object locations. However, the corre-\\nlations between multiple proposals and object categories\\nare ignored. Besides, the global structure information is\\nabandoned by the position-sensitive score maps in R-FCN.\\nTo solve these problems, we can refer to diverse subset\\nselection [217] and sequential reasoning tasks [218] for\\npossible solutions. It is also meaningful to mask salient parts\\nand couple them with the global structure in a joint-learning\\nmanner [219].\\nThe second one is to release the burden on manual labor and\\naccomplish real-time object detection, with the emergence of\\nlarge-scale image and video data. The following three aspects\\ncan be taken into account.\\n• Cascade network. In a cascade network, a cascade of\\ndetectors are built in different stages or layers [180], [220].\\nAnd easily distinguishable examples are rejected at shallow\\nlayers so that features and classiﬁers at latter stages can\\nhandle more difﬁcult samples with the aid of the decisions\\nfrom previous stages. However, current cascades are built in\\na greedy manner, where previous stages in cascade are ﬁxed\\nwhen training a new stage. So the optimizations of different\\nCNNs are isolated, which stresses the necessity of end-to-\\nend optimization for CNN cascade. At the same time, it\\nis also a matter of concern to build contextual associated\\ncascade networks with existing layers.\\n• Unsupervised and weakly supervised learning. It’s\\nvery time consuming to manually draw large quantities\\nof bounding boxes. To release this burden, semantic prior\\n[55], unsupervised object discovery [221], multiple instance\\nlearning [222] and deep neural network prediction [47] can\\nbe integrated to make best use of image-level supervision to\\nassign object category tags to corresponding object regions\\nand reﬁne object boundaries. Furthermore, weakly annota-\\ntions (e.g. center-click annotations [223]) are also helpful\\nfor achieving high-quality detectors with modest annotation\\nefforts, especially aided by the mobile platform.\\n• Network optimization. Given speciﬁc applications and\\nplatforms, it is signiﬁcant to make a balance among speed,'),\n",

However, despite that detection\\naccuracy is reduced, it is more meaningful to learn compact\\nmodels with fewer number of parameters [209]. And this\\nsituation can be relieved by introducing better pre-training\\nschemes [225], knowledge distillation [226] and hint learn-\\ning [227]. DSOD also provides a promising guideline to\\ntrain from scratch to bridge the gap between different image\\nsources and tasks [74].\\nThe third one is to extend typical methods for 2D object de-\\ntection to adapt 3D object detection and video object detection,\\nwith the requirements from autonomous driving, intelligent\\ntransportation and intelligent surveillance.\\n• 3D object detection. With the applications of 3D sensors\\n(e.g. LIDAR and camera), additional depth information can\\nbe utilized to better understand the images in 2D and extend\\nthe image-level knowledge to the real world. However,\\nseldom of these 3D-aware techniques aim to place correct\\n3D bounding boxes around detected objects. To achieve\\nbetter bounding results, multi-view representation [181] and\\n3D proposal network [228] may provide some guidelines to\\nencode depth information with the aid of inertial sensors\\n(accelerometer and gyrometer) [229].\\n• Video object detection. Temporal information across\\ndifferent frames play an important role in understanding\\nthe behaviors of different objects. However, the accuracy\\nsuffers from degenerated object appearances (e.g., motion\\nblur and video defocus) in videos and the network is\\nusually not trained end-to-end. To this end, spatiotemporal\\ntubelets [230], optical ﬂow [199] and LSTM [107] should\\nbe considered to fundamentally model object associations\\nbetween consecutive frames.\\nVIII. CONCLUSION\\nDue to its powerful learning ability and advantages in\\ndealing with occlusion, scale transformation and background\\nswitches, deep learning based object detection has been a\\nresearch hotspot in recent years. This paper provides a detailed\\nreview on deep learning based object detection frameworks\\nwhich handle different sub-problems, such as occlusion, clutter\\nand low resolution, with different degrees of modiﬁcations\\non R-CNN. The review starts on generic object detection\\npipelines which provide base architectures for other related\\ntasks. Then, three other common tasks, namely salient object\\ndetection, face detection and pedestrian detection, are also\\nbrieﬂy reviewed. Finally, we propose several promising future\\ndirections to gain a thorough understanding of the object\\ndetection landscape. This review is also meaningful for the\\ndevelopments in neural networks and related learning systems,\\nwhich provides valuable insights and guidelines for future\\nprogress.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThis research was supported by the National Natural Sci-\\nence Foundation of China (No.61672203 & 61375047 &\\n91746209), the National Key Research and Development Pro-\\ngram of China (2016YFB1000901), and Anhui Natural Sci-\\nence Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar (No.170808J08).\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] P.
